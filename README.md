## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# If you'd like to use a different database other than SQLite, you can go
# to packages/db/prisma and update schema.prisma provider
# or use your own database provider
+ provider = "mysql"

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you have ever deployed a Turborepo app there, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/nextjs` folder as the root directory and apply the following build settings:

> The install command filters out the expo package and saves a few second (and cache size) of dependency installation. The build command makes us build the application using Turbo.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.
